<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## **About The Project**

Hello and welcome to the readme file.

My project is focused on providing a collection of libraries that simplify and enhance the development experience for .NET MAUI, a cross-platform UI framework for building mobile, desktop, and web applications. The libraries I'm offering add new functionalities to your .NET MAUI projects.

### **Features**
Here are some details about the libraries included in this project:

- **Pincode library (MauiCodes):** my pincode library provides a simple and customizable page to add PIN code functionality to your .NET MAUI applications. The library includes different options for keyboard, code viewer, colors, and more.

- **Calendar library (MauiDays):** my calendar library provides a customizable calendar control that can be easily integrated into your .NET MAUI projects to help manage dates. The library includes various features such as multi-language support, month selector, calendar page, and more.

Each library in my project comes with its own documentation, providing detailed information and examples on how to use it in your .NET MAUI projects.

I recommend exploring the documentation to understand the full range of capabilities each librarie offer.

Simply navigate to the corresponding folder in my GitHub repository and look for the documentation file.

I'm committed to provide ongoing support and updates to ensure that they remain compatible with the latest versions of .NET MAUI and other relevant technologies. I appreciate feedback and contributions from the community and encourage you to get in touch with me if you have any questions or suggestions.

Thank you for your interest in my project, and I look forward to seeing what you create with our libraries!

## **BONUS**

If you are new to .NET MAUI or you want to imporve or skills, I also offer a course on this topic. This course is designed to help developers learn from the basics of .NET MAUI development and how to build and publish on Google Play and App Store. You can find more information about the course on my website: https://www.homuai.com/homuai-course.
